By introducing the **`ntn_`** prefix, we aim to:\n\n", "\n\n* Enhance compatibility with secret scanners and other security tools, making it easier to identify and manage Notion API tokens.\n* Provide a clearer distinction between Notion API tokens and other types of secrets, reducing the risk of misconfiguration and improving overall security.\n", "\n#### What Do You Need to Do?\n\n", "\n\n* New Integrations: For any new integrations, the tokens will be automatically generated with the **`ntn_`** prefix. Simply generate your tokens as usual through the Notion API settings page.\n* Existing Tokens: All existing tokens with the secret\\_ prefix will continue to work without any changes. There is no immediate need to update your existing integrations.\n* Token Format: We strongly advise against using regular expressions (regex) to identify or validate Notion Public API tokens. The token format may change over time, and relying on regex patterns could lead to false positives or negatives. Instead, treat the token as an opaque string and use it as provided.\n* Best Practices: To handle Notion API tokens securely:\n  + Store tokens securely using appropriate encryption methods.\n  + Use Notion's official SDKs or libraries when available, as they handle token management correctly.\n  + Validate tokens by making authenticated requests to Notion's API rather than parsing the token itself.\n", "\n#### Questions or Concerns?\n\n", "\n\nIf you have any questions or need assistance with this transition, please feel free to reach out to our support team or visit our docs.\n\n"]}, "september-9-2024": {"date_text": "September 9, 2024", "content": ["\n\n* Revised **Section 3.1** of the [Developer Terms](https://www.notion.so/Developer-Terms-ba4131408d0844e08330da2cbb225c20) to include additional security and data use restrictions.\n"]}, "changes-for-april-2024": {"date_text": "Changes for April 2024", "content": ["\n\n* Added: New property `in_trash` to indicate whether a page/block/database has been deleted or placed in \"Trash\".\n* Support: Both `archived` and `in_trash` properties are fully supported.

After a brief transition period (see \"How to prepare for this change\" below) we will be switching exclusively to user-level tokens. These can be granted by any admin or member in the workspace, and there can be as many tokens per workspace as there are admins and members in the workspace.\n\n", "\n\nSee the table for the differences between these two methods:\n\n", "\n\n|  | Workspace-level tokens (old) | User-level tokens (new) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Who can go through OAuth and grant access | Admins only | Admins and members |\n| Number of access tokens per workspace | 1 | Up to N, where N is the number of admins and members |\n| Who can go through OAuth and reauthorize access for a given token | Only the original user who went through OAuth to grant the token | Only the original user who went through OAuth to grant the token |\n| OAuth token response | Contains an `owner` field with the value `{ workspace: true }` | Contains an `owner` field with the value `{ user: <API user object> }` |\n| What resources an integration has access to | Pages/databases the installing user chooses via the page picker during OAuth; pages/databases the installing user and other users in the workspace share with the integration via the Page menu; children of pages/databases that were shared with the integration | Pages/databases the installing user chooses via the page picker during OAuth; pages/databases the installing user shares with the integration via the Page menu; children of pages/databases that were shared with the integration |\n| What an integration can do with resources it has access to | Read and write | Read and write |\n\n", "\n#### How to prepare for this change:\n\n", "\n\nThis change only affects public integrations; that is, integrations that can be installed across many workspaces via OAuth. It does not affect internal integrations.\n\n", "\n\n1. Ensure that you can store and handle multiple Notion API tokens per workspace where your integration is granted access. You may map tokens directly to the `bot_id` which is returned in the OAuth token response and is guaranteed to be unique per API token.\n   * To avoid overwriting tokens, do not map the token to the `workspace_id` returned in the OAuth token response, since a workspace may have multiple tokens. Do not map the token to the `owner.user.id` in the OAuth token response, since a user may install your integration in multiple workspaces.\n2. Add `&owner=user` to your OAuth authorization URL (the url starting with `https://api.notion.com/v1/oauth/authorize`) once your application is ready for user-level tokens.\n", "\n#### What to expect on October 19\n\n", "\n\nOn October 19, we will migrate all existing workspace-level tokens to user-level tokens.
